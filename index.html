        Snorkelling is an activity in which a person swims using a mask, snorkel
        and swimming aids such as fins, but without using self-contained
        underwater breathing apparatus <em>SCUBA</em>. <br />Snorkelling
        includes both snorkel swimming and snorkel diving. Snorkel swimming is
        snorkelling on the surface of the water.
